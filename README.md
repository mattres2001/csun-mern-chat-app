# csun-mern-chat-app
Real-time MERN-stack chat app designed for and by CSUN students

To access, first go into terminal and initialize the frontend

For frontend: cd client -> yarn install -> yarn dev

if you did it right, it should show "vite v_._._ ready in _ ms"

After, you should initialize the backend api

For backend: open another terminal window -> cd api -> nodemon index.js

If you did it right, it should show "Connected to MongoDB"

You should open two webpages to test the chat feature, preferably on two different browsers (i.e. Edge and Chrome)

You should inspect element on both and check console/network when needed, in case you have any bugs

# Usage
In terminal, run 'npm install'
To run frontend client, cd to './client' and run 'yarn dev' in terminal
To run backend api, cd to './api' and run 'nodemon index.js' in terminal
